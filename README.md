#  Page View Time Series Visualizer

This project is part of the **freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python certification**.  
It visualizes time series data of daily page views on the freeCodeCamp forum from **2016-05-09** to **2019-12-03** using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

##  Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore and visualize trends and seasonality in page views using:
-  **Line Plot**: Shows daily page views over time.
-  **Bar Plot**: Displays average daily page views per month, grouped by year.
- **Box Plots**: Visualize the distribution of page views per year and per month.

## Built With
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## What I learned
- Cleaning time series data
- Grouping data and calculating aggregates
- Drawing clear and meaningful visualizations
- Using box plots to spot trends and seasonality

## Visualizations
Here’s what you get after running the notebook:
- `line_plot.png` – Daily views over the years
- `bar_plot.png` – Average daily page views per month & year
- `box_plot.png` – Distribution per year & per month

## Usage
Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
